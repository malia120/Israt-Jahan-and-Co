Step By step what i have done to create this website.
1) installed the react app. by doing npx create-react-app frontend
2) I deleted the files and code i dont need
3) created pages 
4) created Home page
    4a) imported react from the react library
    4b) created a functional component named home
    4c) exported Home component, to make it accessible everywhere
5) i then updated my App.js page, by removing all the code
    5a) i then imported react from react library
    5b) i then did npm install react-router-dom, which has many functions, like display the web pages and allow users to nagivate through the pages
    5c) created functional component called App, and the App component as default, making it accessible everywhere.
    5d) imported the react-router-dom, especially Browser Router as Router, Routes and Route. This keeps UI in sync with the URL.
    5e) i then imported the Home page by:
        5ei) importing the home component by doing 'import home', and then located where i imported the component, in this case, "from './Pages/Home';"
    5f) I then wrap the app in Router, which allows routing, and then have it be wrapped in routes
    5g) i then define the actual route or path, where when the path is '/', which is the root path, the Home component is rendered. 
6) i then updated the Home page, to ensure that home page is successfully rendered, by returning the heading "Home page".
7) i also added an about page, the exam same way as the home page

Errors I have experienced:
1) whenever i try running my website, by doing npm start, it keeps saying "node_module/.bin" not recognised.
    i had fixed this error message by renaming the folder from Israt Jahan & Co to Israt Jahan co
